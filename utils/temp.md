Field (line: 14, key: `abstract`): `Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for solving problems involving complex probability distributions. Despite their versatility, these methods often suffer from inefficiencies, especially when dealing with rare events. As such, importance sampling emerged as a prominent technique for alleviating these challenges. Recently, a new scheme called Abstraction Sampling was developed that incorporated stratification to importance sampling over graphical models. However, existing work only explored a limited set of abstraction functions that guide  stratification. This study introduces three new classes of abstraction functions combined with seven distinct partitioning schemes, resulting in twenty-one new abstraction functions, each motivated by theory and intuition from both search and sampling domains. An extensive empirical analysis on over 400 problems compares these new schemes highlighting several well-performing candidates.`

Field (line: 13, key: `abstract`): `Spatial evolutionary games are used to model large systems of interacting agents. In earlier work, a method was developed using Bayesian Networks to approximate the population dynamics in these games. One of the advantages of the Bayesian Network modeling approach is that it is possible to smoothly adjust the size of the network to get more accurate approximations. However, scaling the method up can be intractable if the number of strategies in the evolutionary game increases. In this paper, we propose a new method for computing more accurate approximations by using surrogate Bayesian Networks. Instead of computing inference on larger networks directly, we perform inference on a much smaller surrogate network extended with parameters that exploit the symmetry inherent to the domain. We learn the parameters on the surrogate network using KL-divergence as the loss function. We illustrate the value of this method empirically through a comparison on several evolutionary games.`

Field (line: 14, key: `abstract`): `Estimating the effects of multi-dimensional treatments (i.e., joint treatment effects) is critical in many data-intensive domains, including genetics and drug evaluation. The main challenges for studying the joint treatment effects include the need for large sample sizes to explore different treatment combinations as well as potentially unsafe treatment interactions. In this paper, we develop machinery for estimating joint treatment effects by combining data from multiple experimental datasets. In particular, first, we develop new identification conditions for determining whether a joint treatment effect can be computed in terms of multiple interventional distributions under various scenarios. Further, we develop estimators with statistically appealing properties, including consistency and robustness to model misspecification and slow convergence. Finally, we perform simulation studies, which corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.`

In addition, we consider PoC for a sub-population and PoC with multi-hypothetical terms to capture more sophisticated counterfactual information useful for decision-making. We provide a nonparametric identification theorem for each type of PoC we introduce. Finally, we illustrate the application of our results on a real-world dataset about education.`

Field (line: 0, key: `abstractNote`): `Reasoning about the effect of interventions and counterfactuals is a fundamental task found throughout the data sciences. A collection of principles, algorithms, and tools has been developed for performing such tasks in the last decades. One of the pervasive requirements found throughout this literature is the articulation of assumptions, which commonly appear in the form of causal diagrams. Despite the power of this approach, there are significant settings where the knowledge necessary to specify a causal diagram over all variables is not available, particularly in complex, high-dimensional domains. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical modeling tool called cluster DAGs (for short, C-DAGs) that allows for the partial specification of relationships among variables based on limited prior knowledge, alleviating the stringent requirement of specifying a full causal diagram. A C-DAG specifies relationships between clusters of variables, while the relationships between the variables within a cluster are left unspecified, and can be seen as a graphical representation of an equivalence class of causal diagrams that share the relationships among the clusters. We develop the foundations and machinery for valid inferences over C-DAGs about the clusters of variables at each layer of Pearl’s Causal Hierarchy - L1 (probabilistic), L2 (interventional), and L3 (counterfactual). In particular, we prove the soundness and completeness of d-separation for probabilistic inference in C-DAGs. Further, we demonstrate the validity of Pearl’s do-calculus rules over C-DAGs and show that the standard ID identification algorithm is sound and complete to systematically compute causal effects from observational data given a C-DAG. Finally, we show that C-DAGs are valid for performing counterfactual inferences about clusters of variables.`

This paper deals with the problem of estimating the probabilities of causation when treatment and effect are not binary. Pearl defined the binary probabilities of causation, such as the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS), the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability of necessity (PN). Tian and Pearl then derived sharp bounds for these probabilities of causation using experimental and observational data. In this paper, we define and provide theoretical bounds for all types of probabilities of causation with multivalued treatments and effects. We further discuss examples where our bounds guide practical decisions and use simulation studies to evaluate how informative the bounds are for various data combinations.`

Field (line: 0, key: `abstractNote`): `Structural learning is arguably one of the most challenging and pervasive tasks found throughout the data sciences. There exists a growing literature that studies structural learning in non-parametric settings where conditional independence constraints are taken to define the equivalence class. In the presence of unobserved confounders, it is understood that non-conditional independence constraints are imposed over the observational distribution, including certain equalities and inequalities between functionals of the joint distribution. In this paper, we develop structural learning methods that leverage additional constraints beyond conditional independences. Specifically, we first introduce a score for arbitrary graphs combining Watanabe’s asymptotic expansion of the marginal likelihood and new bounds over the cardinality of the exogenous variables. Second, we show that the new score has desirable properties in terms of expressiveness and computability. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that the score captures distinct constraints imprinted in the data, including Verma’s and inequalities’. In terms of computability, we show properties of score equivalence and decomposability, which allows, in principle, to break the problem of structural learning in smaller and more manageable pieces. Third, we implement this score using an MCMC sampling algorithm and test its properties in several simulation scenarios.`

In this paper, we study conditional average partial causal effects (CAPCE) to reveal the heterogeneity of causal effects with continuous treatment. We provide conditions for identifying CAPCE in an instrumental variable setting. Notably, CAPCE is identifiable under a weaker assumption than required by a commonly used measure for estimating heterogeneous causal effects of continuous treatment. We develop three families of CAPCE estimators: sieve, parametric, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based, and analyze their statistical properties. We illustrate the proposed CAPCE estimators on synthetic and real-world data.`

Using a combination of experimental and observational data, Li and Pearl solved the binary unit selection problem (binary treatment and effect) by deriving tight bounds on the &quot;benefit function,&quot; which is the payoff/cost associated with selecting an individual with given characteristics. This paper extends the benefit function to the general form such that the treatment and effect are not restricted to binary.
